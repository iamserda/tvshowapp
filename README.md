# TV SHOWS based on TVMazeAPI

## What is it?

An interface allowing a user to search for a show, and if available(from the tvMAZE API), the show title, cover, summary and seasons will be displayed in a flexible grid interface.
This is not a full implementation of everything available form the API. My intention isn't to reproduce their application.

Thank you to the engineers and staff at tvMaze, it was a pleasure working with your API.
